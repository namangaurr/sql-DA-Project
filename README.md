Key Findings User Engagement: Higher levels of user engagement (more reviews, tips, check-ins) correlate with higher review counts and ratings. Sentiment Analysis: Positive sentiment in reviews contributes to better ratings and more reviews. Time Trends: Consistent user engagement over time is linked with sustained business success.
